                    <h2>A Message from our team: </h2>
                    <p>The ALCONNECT concept aims to establish a connection between our college's alumni and
                         current B.Tech students. This connection facilitates the students in finding mentors who can guide
                          them in their chosen career paths. Simultaneously, it enables the college alumni to give back to the
                           institution. The inspiration behind ALCONNECT comes from our shared interests in 
                           career-oriented courses such as business development, entrepreneurship, and marketing. 
                           Unfortunately, these subjects aren't integrated into our academic curriculum, so we didn't receive 
                           any support or guidance from our faculty or peers.

                            Consequently, our team decided to reach out to our college's alumni network for mentorship in these
                             areas. However, we discovered that our college's alumni management system didn't meet our needs.
                              In response, we decided to create a website that connects our college's alumni with students seeking
                               mentorship in specific domains. This initiative resulted in the development of ALCONNECT. On this 
                               platform, you can provide your information, which we then present to students. They can subsequently
                                get in touch with you for mentorship and career advice.</p>
