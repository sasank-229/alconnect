The ALCONNECT functions as a web-based database platform, facilitating the connection between current students and alumni who have graduated from a college. ALCONNECT features distinct portals for both alumni and students, ensuring that relevant details are accessible to both parties, fostering mutual interaction. I, MMS Sasank, played a pivotal role in designing and creating the website, serving as the technical incharge. The collaborative effort involved a team of 2nd-year Computer Science and Engineering students from Gudlavalleru College, who presented the project as part of a hackathon.

On the GitHub repository, only codes related to design and connections are available due to the absence of database functionality. To implement the website with a database, users can connect it to a localhost and follow these steps:
  1. Create a database named "alumni_register."
  2. Establish three tables within the database: "alumni_record," "student_record," and "alumni_domains."
  3. Refer to the "Database_referral_screenshots" folder for the structural details of each table.
  4. Update the 'connection.php' file to align with the localhost configuration.

 The website was already globalized using the hosting of "000webhost" as the hosting platform, with domain "alconnect"
 The website is live at url
